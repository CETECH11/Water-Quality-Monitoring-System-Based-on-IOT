In the 21st century, there were lots of inventions, but at the same time when pollution, global warming, and so on are being formed, because of this, there is no safe drinking water for the world’s pollution. Nowadays, water quality monitoring in real-time faces challenges because of global warming limited water resources, growing population, etc. Hence, there is a need of developing better methodologies to monitor the water quality parameters in real-time. Water pollution is one of the biggest fears of green globalization.

To ensure a safe supply of drinking water, the quality needs to be monitored in real-time. In this project, we present a design and development of a low-cost system for real-time monitoring of the water quality in IOT (internet of things). The system consists of several sensors used to measure the physical and chemical parameters of the water. The parameters such as temperature, PH, turbidity, and flow sensor of the water can be measured. The measured values from the sensors can be processed by the core controller.

The ESP32 model can be used as a core controller. Finally, the sensor data can be viewed on the internet using a WI-FI system.

The Turbidity sensor detects water quality by measuring turbidity levels. It detects dissolved particles in water using light by measuring light transmittance and scattering rate, which vary with the amount of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water. The level of liquid turbidity rises as the TTS rises. DS18B20 is a pre-wired and waterproofed version of the DS18B20 sensor. It is handy for use when you need to measure something far away, or in wet conditions. The Sensor can measure the temperature between -55 to 125 °C (-67 °F to +257 °F). The cable is jacketed in PVC

A pH sensor is one of the most essential tools that’s typically used for water measurements. This type of sensor can measure the amount of alkalinity and acidity in water and other solutions. When used correctly, pH sensors can ensure the safety and quality of a product and the processes that occur within a wastewater or manufacturing plant.

In most cases, the standard pH scale is represented by a value that can range from 0-14. When a substance has a pH value of seven, this is considered to be neutral. Substances with a pH value above seven represent higher amounts of alkalinity, whereas substances with a pH value that’s lower than seven are believed to be more acidic. For instance, toothpaste typically comes with a pH value of 8-9. On the other hand, stomach acid has a pH value of two.

The difference between an alkaline substance and an acidic substance is very important for any company that uses a cooling tower, boiler, manufacturing processes, swimming pool control, and various types of environmental monitoring. The human body has a standard pH level of 7.4, which is essential for the body to run effectively. If the composition of the body ever becomes too acidic or overly alkaline, it will look to return to the neutral state.
